# Initializing Amplitude.js
To initialize Amplitude.js, you must call the Amplitude.init() method and pass
in an object that contains an array of songs and settings. Amplitude.js will
then take care of configuring and setting up your player by finding all of the
Amplitude elements (defined later in the docs) and binding the appropriate
event handlers.

To configure Amplitude.js, you need to call the init function on the Amplitude
object and you can pass it a JSON object of configuration variables ( we will
go through ALL of these in the documentation ). At the bare minimum, you need
to pass it all of the song objects that your page will be using. More
information about the song object next.

```javascript
	Amplitude.init({
		"songs": [
			{
				"name": "Song Name 1",
				"artist": "Artist Name",
				"album": "Album Name",
				"url": "/song/url.mp3",
				"cover_art_url": "/cover/art/url.jpg"
			},
			{
				"name": "Song Name 2",
				"artist": "Artist Name",
				"album": "Album Name",
				"url": "/song/url.mp3",
				"cover_art_url": "/cover/art/url.jpg"
			},
			{
				"name": "Song Name 3",
				"artist": "Artist Name",
				"album": "Album Name",
				"url": "/song/url.mp3",
				"cover_art_url": "/cover/art/url.jpg"
			}
		]
	});
```

This configuration will set up Amplitude.js to work the way you want it. The
config JSON is used heavily to configure and optimize Amplitude.js for what
your app needs.
