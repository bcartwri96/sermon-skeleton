# Defaulting Shuffle On

You can turn shuffle on right away when initializing AmplitudeJS. To do that, simply initialize AmplitudeJS with the `shuffle_on` parameter like this:

```javascript
  Amplitude.init({
    songs: ['...'],
    shuffle_on: true
  });
```

By default, AmplitudeJS will shuffle the songs and start with the first song in the shuffled list.
