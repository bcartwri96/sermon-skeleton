AmplitudeJS allows you to stop playing a song after it has been finished. To stop a song after it has been finished playing you need to configure AmplitudeJS with the `continue_next` flag set to `false` on initialization. By default, AmplitudeJS will go to the next song in the list or playlist depending on state. To set the flag as false, initialize AmplitudeJS with the following parameter:

```javascript
  Amplitude.init({
    "songs": [...],
    "continue_next": false
  });
```
