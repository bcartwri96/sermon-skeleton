# Setting the Default Playback Speed

By default, AmplitudeJS plays back the audio at the normal speed of `1.0`. However, you can initialize AmplitudeJS to play at `1.5`x the normal rate or `2.0`x times the normal rate. To do that, you can set the `playback_speed` attribute on initialization.

```javascript
  Amplitude.init({
    songs: ['...'],
    playback_speed: 2.0
  });
```
